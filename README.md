# Code Refrctoire Starter Code

## This was a refactor code form challege 1 where we took an already working code for a website and simply made it easier to navigate by simply cleanign it up and applying some new text to it to make it more user friendly.  

- My motivation was simply because i wanted to get better. I sturggle a lot but i got a better and that was my drive.

-I built this because it was something that was gonna happen later in the future. They need the help I needed the exprince. 

- ONe problem that was solved was the next person would be able to read it easier. 

- I learned more about html and how to use text. I'm still very new however this project helped me understand what i don't know and how html works, as well as what i can work on.
